## Chapter 22: Password Validation

### Task of Part 1 and 2

Please create a project that includes a **password input field**.

- When the user clicks on the input field and the password length is **less than 10 digits**, display the message **“Please enter a minimum 10-digit password.”** inside a `<p>` tag.

- While the user is typing the password, a **loading effect** should appear beside the input field using the `oninput` event.

- Once the password length becomes **10 digits or more**, replace the loading effect with a **tick (✔) icon** to indicate that the password requirement has been met.
